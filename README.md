# Ai-Connect4-Project
Connect 4 is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping their colored discs from the top into a grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect-four ofoneâ€™s own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The two players keep playing until the board is full. The winner is the player having greater number of connected-fours.
